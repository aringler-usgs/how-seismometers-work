**Retrieving Signals from a Noisy World: How seismometers work**

This workshop will provide an overview of how seismic instrumentation works. It will overview how raw ground motion is sensed by a seismic sensor and then converted from digital counts to more tangible units of velocity or acceleration. We assume no prior knowledge of seismic instrumentation or data collection methods, making it ideal for graduate students or anyone interested in understanding how seismic data is recorded. The goal is to provide participants with basic understanding of how seismic data is recorded, how the instrumentation works, as well as possible pitfalls and complications that can arise in the process. By better understanding the physical and electronic limitations of seismic instruments, we hope that participants will have a better grasp on limitations of processing and interpreting the seismic data. Hands on exercises will help participants gain exposure to working with seismic data from the perspective of the instrument. 

Participants will learn:
- Elements of modern seismic sensors
- Some of the limitations in modern seismometers (e.g. self-noise) as well as how the response of the instrument works
- Basic knowledge of how seismometers with force-feedback electronics work and will understand differences between symmetric triaxial (Galperin) and conventional triaxial sensor element configurations
- Properties of seismic sensors such as dynamic range, gain, and damping
- How sensors are built and created

This git repository will contain the teaching materials for this course. Which will include a number of Python notebooks. 

The course agenda is broken into the following sections:

- Topic 1 : Sensors 
    
    How do they work and what sensors are capable of recording what
- Topic 2 : calibration/noise/other specifications
  
  How do we know what we are recording and what are some of the limitations of our units
- Short break

- Topic 3 : Responses

  What is the instrument response and how do we remove it
- Topic 4 : hands on practices

  Additional hands on practice with data to reinforce the above topics
